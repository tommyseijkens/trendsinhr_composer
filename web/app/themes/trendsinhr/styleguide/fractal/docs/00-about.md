---

This fractal contains an overview of the basic Bootstrap implementation for the Driessen Groep.

## Purpose

This project is the base of all other bootstrap projects.  The purpose of this styleguide is that other developers only have to include styles & scripts from this resource so they can start developing the back-end right away.

## Usage

Developers only have to include the following files:

**Inside the `<head>` tag:**

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./dist/css/style.min.css">
```

**Before the closing `</body>` tag:**

```
<script src="./dist/js/vendors.min.js' }}"></script>
<script src="./dist/js/scripts.min.js' }}"></script>
```
